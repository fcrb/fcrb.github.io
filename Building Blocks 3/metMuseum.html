			<h3>The Guerilla Girls</h3>
				<p>
				“Guerrilla Girls grew out of a demonstration in 1985 by a group of women artists protesting an exhibition titled An International Survey of Painting and Sculpture, mounted at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and billed as an up-to-the-minute survey of the most significant contemporary art in the world. The show featured 148 men, 13 women, and no artists of color. The women artists were moved to action not only by this disparity but also by the words of the show's curator, who said that any artist who wasn't in the show should rethink "his" career” (Getty.edu).
