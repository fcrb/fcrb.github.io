			<h3>The Guerrilla Girls</h3>
				<p>
				The Guerrilla Girls are a group of artists borne out of the rise of feminism in art movement that began to take hold in the late 70s and early 80s.
	</p>
				<p>
				While their ambitions began directed towards the activism of fighting for representation and against discrimination for women artists and artists of color, it began to expand to a more comprehensive plethora of social agendas.
	</p>
				<p>
				Their fervor for fighting and appetite for going against huge names in the art industry has over the decades created a huge spike in awareness and ability to hold museums and the like accountable for spreading ideals of equality and much needed change.
